# Sasquatchsightings
<h2>Sasquatch sightings is a website that I made using Spring tools that is about users posting their sightings and viewing other users 
sightings of the infamous sasquatch.</h2>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>I learned how to make a MySQL database that saves a users data and make new users with it. I learned how to route, stylize, work and connect 
the front-end and the back-end of the servers using MySQL and JAVA. </p>
